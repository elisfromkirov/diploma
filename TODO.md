# Tasks #

Major tasks:
- replace support with contacts found by HPP collision library (I suppose this is right way to do it, but I'm not completely sure)
- calculate centroidal momentum matrix (I suggest to use pin.ccrba())
- include balance objectives
- try controller
- clean up temp direcotry
- add documentation

Minor tasks:
- compile diploma template

# Results #

Current controller works fine, but it does nothing. So, let's try balancing objective.

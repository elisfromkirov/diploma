# Tasks #

Major tasks:
- refactor code a bit
- calculate torgues and external forces in right way (compatible with aba, because forward dynamics will be don using this algorithm)
- try controller
- replace support with contacts found by HPP collision library (I suppose this is right way to do it, but I'm not completely sure)
- calculate centroidal momentum matrix
- include balance objectives
- try controller
- what's with documentation? remove or rewrite it.

Minor tasks:
- compile bibliography
- adjust diploma template
